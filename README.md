# Mug Engine

This is a set of utilities for MonoGame. It's a quasi game engine.

This code was intially written for Arid Arnold. This is an effort to separate it out into it's own library.

The name is a combination of the first 3 letters of my name, and MonoGame. It's also a play on words or perhaps even an acronym: "MonoGame Utility Goodies"? You decide.
